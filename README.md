This is a recipe website to utilize all of the basic HTML that i've learned thus far through Project Odin. It may not look pretty but this should be the first step into feeling more comfortable with coding. The recipe will be for something basic like steak tacos. I feel maybe a little over confident about it at this point but we will see what happens.
